<br>To Whom It May Concern:
<br>
<br>I am hereby requesting immediate erasure of personal data concerning me according to Article 17 GDPR.
<br>
<br>If I have given consent to the processing of my personal data (e.g. according to Article 6(1) or Article 9(2) GDPR),
I am hereby withdrawing said consent for the entire process.
<br>
<br>In addition, I am objecting to the processing of personal data concerning me (which includes profiling), according
to Article 21 GDPR. I request that you restrict the processing of the data concerning me pending the verification whether
your legitimate grounds override mine, pursuant to Art. 18(1)(d) GDPR.
<br>
<br>If you have made the aforementioned data public, you are obliged pursuant to Article 17(2) GDPR to take all
reasonable steps to inform other controllers, including search engine operators, who process the personal data
listed above, that I have requested the erasure of all links, copies or replications. This applies not only to exact
copies of the data concerned, but also to those from which information contained in the data concerned can be derived.
<br>
<br>In case you have disclosed the affected personal data to third parties, you have to communicate my request for
erasure of the affected personal data, as well as any references to it, to each recipient as laid down in Article 19
GDPR. Please also inform me about those recipients.
<br>
<br>My request explicitly includes any other services and companies for which you are the controller as defined by Article 4(7) GDPR.
<br>
<br><b>As laid down in Article 12(3) GDPR, you have to confirm the erasure to me without undue delay and in any
    event within one month of receipt of the request.</b>
<br>
<br>I am including the following information necessary to identify me: {{EMAIL}}
<br>
<br>If you do not answer my request within the stated period, I am reserving the right to take legal action against you
and to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority.
<br>
